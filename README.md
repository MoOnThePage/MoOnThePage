# MAAL | Design Automation
- 👋 Hi, I’m **MAAL** — I design and build custom electronics and smart hardware systems.
- 👀 I’m interested in **PCB design**, **embedded systems**, and building **smart electronics projects**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Rust for embedded systems** and exploring **Verilog for digital design**.
- 🤝 I’d love to connect with others on **PCB design**, **Rust** or **C firmware development**, or general **hardware projects**. While I work solo right now and can't promise full-time commitment, I’m always open to learning and contributing where I can.
- 📫 Feel free to open an issue on one of my repositories if you'd like to reach out.
